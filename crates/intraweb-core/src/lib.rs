//! Core types for intraweb: your neighborhood web.

//! The organizing idea is that a person is a keypair and a folder, and a hub is
//! only a place to meet. Nothing here knows how to talk to a network; that is
//! `intraweb-net`'s job. Keeping the split lets the discovery layer be swapped
//! or tested without touching identity or storage.
