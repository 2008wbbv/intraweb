# intraweb

**your neighborhood web**

A local-first intranet that needs no internet, no servers, and no setup. Put the
binary on a laptop or a Raspberry Pi, connect to the same Wi-Fi as everyone else,
and you can see each other, visit each other's pages, and send each other mail.

```sh
intraweb up
```

That is the whole setup. Nodes find each other in about a second.

## The idea

Most "local network" software makes one machine the server and everybody else a
client. Then the server owns your account, your files, and your name, and when
it goes away, so do you.

intraweb does it the other way round:

- **You are a keypair and a folder.** Your identity is an Ed25519 key in your
  vault. Copy the vault to another machine and you are still you.
- **Hubs are places, not owners.** A hub keeps a roster and offers a memorable
  address. It stores none of your content and cannot create or revoke you.
- **One folder, many neighborhoods.** Join a hub at home, another at the
  makerspace, a third at a field site. All three serve the same vault. Nothing
  is copied, and leaving takes nothing away.

The closest familiar comparison is Mastodon's federation, minus the part where
your data lives on somebody's instance.

## Install

Single static binary, no runtime dependencies:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2008wbbv/intraweb/main/install.sh | sh
```

That fetches a prebuilt binary if one exists for your machine. If it does not,
the script builds from source instead — and checks first that it can, rather
than letting you find out several screens into a failed compile.

### Building from source

You need Rust and a **C compiler**. Rust shells out to `cc` to link every
binary, and the bundled SQLite is C, so a machine with Rust but no toolchain
(a fresh live session, a minimal container) will fail with
``linker `cc` not found``.

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential   # Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
sudo dnf install -y gcc                   # Fedora, RHEL
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel        # Arch
sudo apk add build-base                   # Alpine
xcode-select --install                    # macOS
```

Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/2008wbbv/intraweb.git
cd intraweb
sh install.sh          # builds and installs to ~/.local/bin
# or: cargo build --release   → target/release/intraweb
```

For off-grid provisioning, copying the finished binary over with `scp` or a USB
stick works exactly as well — there is nothing else to install, and the machine
you copy it to needs no toolchain at all.

## Use

```sh
intraweb up                        # join the neighborhood
intraweb up --hub --hub-name oak   # host a hub at intranet.local
intraweb up --tui                  # same thing, in the terminal
intraweb serve ./photos            # publish a folder to the neighborhood
intraweb surf                      # see what the neighbors are publishing
intraweb mail send bob -m "hi"     # write to a neighbor
intraweb mail                      # read what you have been sent
intraweb ls bob                    # what is bob sharing?
intraweb get bob maps/ridge.pdf    # fetch it (resumes if interrupted)
intraweb doctor                    # why can't I see anyone?
intraweb id                        # my fingerprint, for verifying in person
```

Open the dashboard at `http://intranet.local` (or `http://localhost:8420` if no
hub is running). It is plain HTML and JavaScript, and works on any phone on the
network.

### Your vault

```
~/.intraweb/
  identity.key   secret   your key — back this up, it is your name everywhere
  config.toml    private  nickname and preferences
  intraweb.db    private  who you have met, which hubs you have visited
  site/          PUBLIC   your mini-site, served at /~yourname
  files/         PUBLIC   media and downloads neighbors can pull
```

Drop an `index.html` in `site/` and it is live at every hub you join. Point
`$INTRAWEB_VAULT` somewhere else to run more than one node on one machine.


## In the terminal

`intraweb up --tui` gives the same roster as the browser dashboard, reading the
same live state — useful over SSH on a headless Pi.

```

`*` marks a neighbor whose fingerprint you have checked in person. A neighbor
using a name you have seen before on a **different key** is called out in red
rather than quietly shown as a familiar face.

## Publishing and browsing

Publish any folder without copying it into your vault:

```sh
intraweb serve ./photos
```

The folder is served in place at `/~yourname`, on every hub you are joined to,
and your vault's own `site/` is left exactly as it was.

To see what everyone else is publishing:

```
Looking around the neighborhood for 3s...

*  1  alice     Basecamp Notice Board               http://192.0.2.2:8480/~alice
   2  bob       A corner of the neighborhood web    http://192.0.2.2:8481/~bob
   3  carol     A corner of the neighborhood web    http://192.0.2.2:8482/~carol

* hub
Open one with: intraweb surf --open <number>
```

`surf` asks each neighbor directly and shows the page's own `<title>`. There is
no index and no crawler — the roster supplies addresses and your machine speaks
to theirs. A neighbor that is announcing but not answering is listed as such
instead of being hidden, and a name that has changed keys carries a warning with
the fingerprint you need to tell the two apart.

## Mail

```sh
intraweb mail send alice -s "fuel drop" -m "Thursday 0600."
intraweb mail            # inbox
intraweb mail outbox     # including anything still queued
```

Every message is signed with your key, so the sender cannot be forged, and goes
straight to the recipient's node. Nothing passes through a hub.

Addressing is by **key**, not by name. You may type a nickname and it will be
resolved, but if two keys answer to that nickname the send is refused and you
are shown both fingerprints to choose between — picking one for you would be a
guess about the thing that matters most.

Writing to somebody who is not around is normal: the message waits in your
outbox and leaves the moment they appear. You can address a public key you have
never seen, so a key written on paper is enough to write to someone.

## Files

```sh
intraweb ls alice                       # what alice is sharing
intraweb get alice maps/survey.tif      # fetch it
```

Downloads resume. If a transfer dies at 400 MB, running the same command again
asks for the rest rather than starting over, and nothing is ever held in memory,
so file size does not decide whether a transfer succeeds.

Anything you drop in your vault's `files/` folder is what neighbors see here.

## Trust

There are no passwords, and no certificate authority — neither would mean much
on an open LAN with no internet.

Instead, every announcement is signed. A node **cannot** announce itself under
someone else's key; the signature would not verify. What a node *can* do is pick
any nickname it likes, because nicknames are labels, not identity.

So intraweb watches the one thing that actually signals an impostor: a name you
have seen before turning up on a key you have not. That gets flagged loudly in
the dashboard rather than quietly rendered as a familiar face. To be certain
about someone, compare fingerprints out loud:

```
$ intraweb id
fingerprint  ba10-4253-4e1b-194a
```

Then mark them verified (`v` in the terminal UI, or the button in the dashboard).

## When nobody shows up

Usually the network, not the software. Plenty of consumer access points isolate
wireless clients or drop multicast, and both look identical from the dashboard:
an empty roster.

```sh
intraweb doctor
```

It listens on both discovery paths and tells you which one is working. intraweb
announces over **mDNS** and **UDP broadcast** at the same time precisely because
so many networks quietly break one of them.

## Status

Working today: discovery, portable identity, the roster, the web and terminal
dashboards, diagnostics, `serve`, `surf`, signed store-and-forward mail, and
resumable file transfer.

Still to come: publishing a site from the dashboard, and attaching files to
mail. See `NOTES.md` for the plan and what is still undecided.
