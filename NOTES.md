# NOTES.md — intraweb

Running log of decisions, open questions, and known gaps. Append; do not rewrite.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Discovery, identity, roster, both dashboards, doctor | **done** |
| P1 | Local mail, store-and-forward, signed | **done** |
| P2 | Mini-site publishing from the dashboard | partly — `serve` does it from the CLI; no upload UI |
| P3 | Resumable direct file transfer | **done** — ranged HTTP, `ls` / `get` |
| P4 | Mail attachments (P1 ∪ P3) | not started |
| — | Release CI, cross-compiled musl + macOS binaries | **done** |

Schema is at v2: v1 created the keyring and the mail table, v2 added unread
tracking and the inbound-duplicate guard. Migrations are additive and a vault
from the first release opens without the operator doing anything.

### Update: 2026-09-11
* **Decisions/Changes**: Pre-build architecture settled and P0 built. Rust
  workspace (`core` / `net` / `cli`), edition 2024. Identity is Ed25519 with
  trust-on-first-use; seeded from `getrandom` into `SigningKey::from_bytes`
  rather than taking an RNG parameter, so the crate is not coupled to whichever
  `rand_core` major `ed25519-dalek` currently tracks (3.0 wants 0.10).
  Federation model revised mid-session per Ben: hubs own nothing, a node joins
  many hubs at once and serves one portable vault to all of them — Mastodon's
  shape without the data gravity. This killed the earlier `ben@basecamp`
  node-scoped addressing; identity is the pubkey, nickname is decoration.
  Presence is signed and travels two ways (mDNS TXT + UDP broadcast beacon),
  with a hand-built canonical encoding because a signature is only worth
  something if both sides agree byte-for-byte. Dashboard is web + ratatui, both
  reading one shared `Roster` object rather than the TUI doing HTTP to itself.
  `doctor` ships in P0 as argued: it separates "nobody here" from "your AP is
  isolating clients", which otherwise look identical.
* **Known Bugs/Gaps**: Two real bugs found by end-to-end testing, both fixed
  with named regression tests: (1) a node recorded its own echoed beacon in its
  own keyring, because self-echo was dropped at the registry rather than before
  the database write; (2) `--port` was silently swallowed by the hub's port-80
  preference, leaving the operator curling a dead port. Still open: TUI is
  local-only (a remote TUI would need an HTTP client, deferred rather than pull
  in `reqwest` against the lean-binary goal); no release CI or cross-compile
  matrix yet, so `install.sh` points at releases that do not exist until that
  lands; transport port 8421 is announced but nothing listens on it until P1;
  beacon replay is bounded only by a 300s clock-skew window, which is
  proportionate for LAN presence but is not a nonce.

### Update: 2026-09-11 (P1 + P3 + efficiency)
* **Decisions/Changes**: The open questions are now decided. **Mail and files
  ride the node's own HTTP port** rather than a bespoke socket protocol, so
  `transport_port` is gone and the wire format is protocol v2. This was the
  session's biggest call: `ServeDir` already answers Range requests, so
  resumable transfer existed for free and a whole framed protocol was deleted
  before being written. Verified against a 30 MB file truncated mid-transfer —
  server returns 206, the resumed file's SHA-256 matches the original.
  **Mail addressing is key-anchored**: a nickname resolves, a nickname held by
  two keys is refused with both fingerprints, and a bare public key always
  works so you can write to someone from a key on paper. Mail to an offline
  peer queues and the sender's outbox loop delivers when they appear
  (verified live: queued to a never-seen key, carol came online, delivered).
  Three efficiency changes, each justified rather than speculative: keyring
  write-through throttled to 60s (was a SQLite UPDATE per peer per 2s beacon —
  pointless flash wear on an SD card), interface enumeration cached for 30s
  (was a full `getifaddrs` every announce, forever), and the dashboard's two
  polls merged into one `/api/state`. A running node now publishes its bound
  port in `runtime.json`, so local commands read its roster instead of
  re-discovering: `mail send` went from 3s to 0.019s. Release CI added
  (musl x86_64/aarch64 + both macOS arches), so `install.sh` finally points at
  artifacts that will exist.
* **Considered and rejected**: caching the roster snapshot. `last_seen` changes
  on every sighting, so the cache would invalidate almost as often as it was
  read — real complexity, near-zero gain.
* **Known Bugs/Gaps**: Four bugs found and fixed this pass. (1) Throttling
  write-through made a verified peer look unverified for up to a minute;
  `Roster::note_verified` now applies it instantly, which is better than the
  old behavior. (2) `mail send` marked delivery using "the newest pending row"
  instead of the id `queue` returned — wrong row if two were queued in the same
  second. (3) Mail could not be addressed to anyone out of range at all, which
  defeated the outbox entirely. (4) An expected error (unknown recipient) dumped
  an anyhow backtrace; `main` now prints the error chain and exits 1.
  Still open: no attachments on mail; no upload UI for sites; `surf` re-probes
  with no caching; mail has no delete or reply; the beacon's replay window is
  still a 300s clock-skew bound rather than a nonce; nothing rate-limits inbound
  mail beyond the 256 KiB body cap, so a hostile LAN peer could fill a disk.

<!-- MEMORY_UPDATE_START -->
### Update: 2026-09-11 (later)
* **Decisions/Changes**: Added `intraweb serve <dir>` and `intraweb surf`.
  `serve` publishes a folder in place at `/~nickname` — nothing is copied into
  the vault, so pointing at a directory never disturbs what you normally
  publish; it is `up` with a site override, so all the usual flags apply.
  `surf` probes each neighbor over plain HTTP/1.0 and shows the page's own
  `<title>`; no client crate, so the binary stays lean. Two boundaries were
  decided by CLAUDE.md rather than convenience: HTTP probing lives in
  `intraweb-cli` because `intraweb-net` must not know what a web page is, and
  the surf listing shows conflict warnings with fingerprints because rule 3
  requires name/key conflicts to be *shown*. Added `Node::observe` /
  `MdnsNode::observer` so surfing listens without announcing — verified in a
  live three-node run that the surfer never appeared in anyone's roster.
  TUI screenshots captured from the real binary via tmux `capture-pane`.
* **Known Bugs/Gaps**: Three more bugs found and fixed, each with a named
  regression test: (1) the TUI header was sized 4 rows while drawing 3 lines
  plus borders, silently clipping "N neighbor(s) online" — now an asserted
  invariant; (2) roster columns were unaligned because nickname width varied;
  (3) the doctor test asserted an empty network and failed the moment real
  nodes were running — rewritten to assert invariants instead. Still open: no
  way to open a peer's site from inside the TUI (surf covers it from the CLI);
  `surf` re-probes every run with no caching, fine on a LAN but wasteful on a
  large roster; `serve` does not watch the folder, so it serves whatever is on
  disk at request time (which is actually the desired behavior, but means no
  notification if the folder is deleted underneath it).

## Open questions for Ben

Answered in session (recorded so they are not re-litigated):

1. Topology — hub + peers, hub is a meeting point only.
2. Trust — Ed25519 + TOFU, no passwords, no CA.
3. Dashboard — both web and TUI, over one source of truth.
4. Targets — aarch64 + x86_64; Pi Zero / ARMv6 dropped.
5. Federation — many hubs per node, one shared vault. *(revised mid-build)*

Decided while building, no longer open:

6. **Resumable transfers** — yes, and they cost nothing: ranged HTTP.
7. **Release hosting** — GitHub Releases, wired up in `.github/workflows`.
8. **Service lifecycle** — not building it. The port-80 fallback prints a real
   `setcap` command, which is all it was ever going to do.
9. **Mail addressing** — by key. Nicknames resolve as a convenience; ambiguity
   is refused rather than guessed.
10. **Transport** — one HTTP port for everything. No second protocol.

Genuinely still open:

11. **Attachments.** Mail carries text. An attachment is a file reference plus a
    pull, not a body — but whose disk holds it until it is fetched?
12. **Inbound mail limits.** Nothing rate-limits a hostile peer beyond the body
    cap. A per-sender quota probably belongs before any wider deployment.
